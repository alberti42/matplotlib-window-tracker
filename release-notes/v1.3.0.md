# Release notes

Make Matplotlib windows feel like a real plotting workstation: keep window geometry stable across runs and keep terminal-run scripts alive without blocking the GUI.

## Highlights

- Window geometry persistence now works on **macOS, Linux, and Windows** — not just macOS. Both the `macosx` and `qtagg` backends are supported and tested.
- Easier setup: after installing the package, run `mpl-patch-for-mwt install` to get the patched matplotlib fork in one command — no manual download or URL needed.
- Smoother multi-figure animations on Qt: both figure windows now update simultaneously on every frame instead of one lagging behind.

## Installing the patched matplotlib

`mpl-patch-for-mwt` stands for **m**atplotlib-**patch**-**for**-**m**atplotlib-**w**indow-**t**racker. It is a console script that installs or restores the patched fork of matplotlib needed for window geometry persistence:

```bash
mpl-patch-for-mwt install    # install the patched fork
mpl-patch-for-mwt uninstall  # restore official matplotlib from PyPI
```

Add `-y` to skip the confirmation prompt. Pre-built wheels are provided for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Notes

- Always-on-top window behavior (`set_window_level`) remains macOS-only.
- The patched fork is hosted at https://github.com/alberti42/fork-matplotlib and relies on APIs from: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31172
- The patched fork cannot be shipped as a standard pip extra because PyPI does not allow direct-URL dependencies. The `mpl-patch-for-mwt` command is the intended alternative.
